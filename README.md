# Course Timer App

Are you currently giving private tuition sessions or do you plan on doing so in the future?

This is a mobile App currently only available for Android that allows you to manage these sessions.
It automatically keeps track on how much money you earn and how much time you spend, per session and in total.

It's written in Java and uses a local SQLite DB to store data on the users device, so an internet connection is not neccessary to use this app.

## How to use Course Timer

This app allows you to keep an overview of how much money you earned during various sessions.
Just press the start button to start a session and press it again to end it.
You can find this button on the main menu.

If you swipe to the left, you can find an overview of all your sessions, as well as an overview of how much money you earned in total, and the total time you spent teaching.


In the settings you can set your earnings per hour as well as the currency you want to use.

The latter only has visual effects though, you can change it any time, but money will not be converted from one currency to another.


## How do I get this app?

You can build the app yourself using the source code and install it on your phone using ADB or you can download it from the [Google Play Store](#) (coming soon) and install it directly on your phone.

I'd recommend the latter to take advantage of automated updates.
